# Design

Grouper is a system for defining and managing user groups. It is intended to serve
as a centralized source of truth for organizing people, which can then be referenced
or leveraged by other tools and technologies.

This serves as the general design document for the system. It is separated
into two pieces, first covering the conceptual foundation of the system using domain
language, then deep-diving into the technical implementation.
